Here I will present some experiments to get a TCP connection betwen Private Networks that are connected by NAT.
I want to make that connection without opening Router Nat ports manually, I wan to use Nat Properties.

Requests:
	1. Can use an Server, but no for hight weight data transmision, only for signaling.
	2. Better if it will be TCP connection.
	3. Nat may to have changeble IPv4 for that outside interface.
	4. That TCP connections can encapsulate external information.
	5. Other resources inside private net can be used.

Ways:
	1. Simulate an three-way handshake, betwen PC's from private Networks.
	2. Packet injection, chenging src IP and PORT.

------------------- WAY 2 --------- Packet Injection ------------------------------------------------------------

	Here are some problems:
		
		1. If your Nat router can otput your packets with changed addres.
		2. Server don't know your open port for Private Network 2 connection.

------------------- WAY 1 --------- Three-way Handshake ---------------------------------------------------------

	Here problems are:
		
		1. Network A don't know port that Network B is going to use for connection (nmap intensive rying, using tcp connection 				timmer).
