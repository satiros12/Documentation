Here I will tell about an experimet, taht is:
	== Install an OS on Flash Memory with tahta MBR and GRUB ==
The steps are:
	1. Install SO on a Pendrive.
	2. Install grub in to pendrive.
	3. Try to boot from that.

	#4. Thry to add an entry to usual GRUB, to boot from USB.

I made for today:
	1. Copied Debian partition data to USB.
	2. Configured Grub2 of PC to use init and vmlinuz of USB.
	 --> Finded with /dev/sdc1
	Â¡ERROR! --> Tryed to launch, but didn't finished, at all, and started RAM Little SO, BusyBox.

Future ways:
-- Try to use ram FS, and make synchronizations with Disk.
-- Try to use partial ram FS, nly for some folders.
-- Try to install new OS for USB directly.
-- Try to make LVM partition in USB and try to start Debien from there.
