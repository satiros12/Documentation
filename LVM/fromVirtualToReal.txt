Here I explain an test, that is seems form interesant:
	== Install and configure a virtual machine to execute tahat in real machine ==

There are steps in my experiment:
	1. Install an SO on a Virtual machine in a .img hard disk.
	2. Make all configurations, thata are necesary.
	3. Boot from partition:
		3.1. Boot directly from GRUB to .img file.
		3.2. Copy data in to an LVM partition, and boot that from GRUB.

1. In grub put directly debians LVM, dont work, because is in other LVM's place.
	-- Try to copy all SUB LVM parts to my own LVM_GRUP-- Try to copy all SUB LVM parts to my own LVM_GRUP

(3.2)
	Executed:
		1. First I had my partitions separated in diferent LVM partitions (/etc, /usr, /var ...).
		2. I sawd partitions of that disk and block size with: "fdisk -lu <file>.img"
		3. I mounted first boot partition of debian: 
				"losetup -o <start_block> /dev/loop0 <file>.img"
				"mount /dev/loop0 /boot"
		4. and made a tar of that: "tar -cf Debian_boot.tar /boot" #to preserve vmlinuz and init files.
		5. Copyed thata .tar file to my own home direcotry.
		6. Un mounted that partition:
			umount /boot		
			losetup -d /dev/loop0
		7. Mounted LVM partition to /dev/loop0, same as 3.
		8. -- VGDISPLAY -- Maybe deted new Virtual group, then you can pas to "10" point.
		9. Mount /dev/loop0 /mnt : the see if lvmdispay finded that new Virtual group.
		10. When LVMDISPLAY founded new partition, mount each LVM partitions in a direcotry (Build the tree)
				EX: 
					/LVM-root -> /mnt
					/LVM-etc -> /mnt/etc
					...
		11. Copy All files from foldeer where all is mounted:
			cp -rpf mnt/* /<Target_mounted_Partition>
				#r: With folders. p: Without touching files. f: forced.
		12. Umount all Debian LVM partitions and go to partition where Files are copyed, to taka notes about:
			vmlinuz and init files : where are and names.
		13.Introduce new entry in GRUB2 like in grub2_lvm.txt.
		14. reboot and see. (Be careful with file system format (VM where installed Debian and where is copyed)).
