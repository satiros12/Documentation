Here I explain an test, that is seems form interesant:
	== Install and configure a virtual machine to execute tahat in real machine ==

There are steps in my experiment:
	1. Install an SO on a Virtual machine in a .img hard disk.
	2. Make all configurations, thata are necesary.
	3. Boot from partition:
		3.1. Boot directly from GRUB to .img file.
		3.2. Copy data in to an LVM partition, and boot that from GRUB.
