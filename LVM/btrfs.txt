If you want to resize an LVM partition, then you must to resize tahtas btrfs file system to:
	1.Resize LVM partition.
	2.Resize Btrfs FS mounted:
		btrfs filesystem resize +<size: 10><Type: G> <Directory_mounted_Btrfs_Partition>

That worked for me.
Be sure tahta you have enought space on LVm partition.
