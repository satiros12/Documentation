Resently I fond RAM file systems that have 10s faster than SSD, then I wanted to try that.
I will try to make new partition with ram FS, and see speed by myself.

---With mount------SRC:http://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/943-create-a-ram-disk-in-linux
mount -t [TYPE] -o size=[SIZE] [FSTYPE] [MOUNTPOINT]
Example: mount -t tmpfs -o size=512m tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk
Add to FS tab: 
tmpfs       /mnt/ramdisk tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,noexec,nodiratime,size=1024M   0 0
---With mkfs------SRC:http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-create-linux-ram-disk-filesystem/
# mkfs -q /dev/ram1 8192 #Creating for 8MB
# mkdir -p /ramcache
# mount /dev/ram1 /ramcache
# df -H | grep ramcache

================================ USE RAM FS for DEBIAN =============================================0
	1. Create RAM FS for Debian.
	2. Create a service that check integrity of files on DISK and on RAM, at the same time.
	3. Make service that when SO is shuting down, that service make last check and save last data on Disk.

--- Persistent SO over RAM FS.
